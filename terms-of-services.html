                    its sole discretion. Tion Studios shall have the right to change the scope and features of available

                    virtual in-game currencies for making payments on Tion Studios account(s) or related online stores.
                    However, in the event that you have a justified and acceptable reason for not using virtual in-game
                    currencies within their lifetime, you can send a written request of activation to us, which must
                    include (i) your identity and user information, (ii) the date on which virtual in-game currencies

                    virtual in-game items, virtual in-game currencies other than their permitted use under this
                    Agreement. Tion Studios will be entitled to change the purpose, scope and lifetime of the delivered all
                    in-game items, accounts, virtual in-game currencies at any time without prior notice.

                    When you use a payment method to make payment for Tion Studios game(s), game items, any Tion Studios goods or
                    services, the transaction is made between your device and that of the relevant payment system
                    provider, through Tion Studios’s interface. You agree that Tion Studios will not be responsible for the services,
                    systems, infrastructure and acts of the payment system provider, the completion of the payment
                    transaction or any matter between you and the payment system provider. Any claims, complaints or
                    disputes arising out of or in connection with any transaction between you and the payment system
                    provider cannot be brought against Tion Studios.

                    We use secure transaction technology for encryption of your payment device(s) information. Such
                    encryption technology reasonably mitigates the risk of your card information obtained by
                    unauthorized third parties. We also do not store your payments device(s) information where you use
                    credit card or online POS device to make a payment.

                    If your download or use of Tion Studios content or product(s) are not free, Tion Studios may also charge you taxes
                    or other expenses, in addition to the fee of the content or service. You are also responsible for
                    any fees, including internet connection or mobile fees that you incur when accessing the platforms
                    or using Tion Studios content. The Turkish or European Union or other VAT tax amounts collected by Tion Studios
                    reflect VAT due on the value of any content and services.</p>
